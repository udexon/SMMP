## SMGDB Overview

### A Homoiconic and Self-Evaluating JSON Format

A graph database (GDB) is a graph whose nodes may include any object defined by the properties of the edges and nodes of the graph. 

A graph database can in theory include everything from a text file in a Unix like filesystem to an image in an HTML file.

However, GDB that include Unix files as nodes have not been widely available, representing the "last mile" for an Internet wide graph database.

SMGDB / SMJSON is designed to fill this gap.
