## Graph:Note -- the Ultimate Format for Code, Documents and Database

The brain processes words before one writes them as sentences. However the brain needs an external aid such as SMJSON to form a graph to relate the sentence to other concepts (objects). Other visual aids or diagrams perform similar relationship functions. 

Graph:Note or SMJSON are extensions of the ubiquitous JSON format designed to make it readable and editable by humans, additional graph database functionalities.

[SMJSON (Stack Machine JSON)](https://github.com/udexon/SMMP/blob/master/SMJSON.md) is the original technical term and Graph:Note is the more user friendly brand name, referring to the same thing.

The [SMJSON (Stack Machine JSON)](https://github.com/udexon/SMMP/blob/master/SMJSON.md) article explains the fundamental mechanisms of SMJSON. In this article, we illustrate how to produce documentation using Graph:Note, with graph database functionalities offered by SMGDB (Stack Machine Graph Database).

But only Graph:Note smjson is both readble/editable to human and computer??
