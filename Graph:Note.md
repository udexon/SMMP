## Graph:Note -- the Ultimate Format for Code, Documents and Database

The brain processes words before one writes them as sentences. However the brain needs an external aid such as SMJSON to form a graph to relate the sentence to other concepts (objects). Other visual aids or diagrams perform similar relationship functions. But only Graph:Note smjson is both readble/editable to human and computer??
