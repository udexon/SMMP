## Colon Definition Integrated Billing (CDIB)

Conventional programming frameworks are heterogeneous and there has been no theoretical or practical solution to integrate them.

[SMMP (Stack Machine Metaprogramming)](https://github.com/udexon/SMMP/blob/master/README.md) appears to be the first (as far as we are aware) theoretical and practical that can be used to integrate all know programming langauges and platforms, given the simplicify, flexibility and versatility of of the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

By extending the colon definition in the Forth programming language, we propose the Colon Definition Integrated Billing (CDIB), a  mechanism for software authors (programmers) to claim ownership of a piece of code down to a single colon defition (coldef), thereby allowing the code owner to bill other parties who make use of the code.

CDIB does not aim to contravene the spirit of free software, but rather to enhance it, by empowering free software programmers to selectively charge third parties for use of his (her) code, as no mechanisms exist for this purpose at present.
